This requires long range autonomous strike weaponry. The Joint Strike Fighter does not solve this issue and detrimentally places added pressure on Australia's limited force of aerial refuelling assets. The world's defence manufacturers are not creating strike platforms that solve Australian needs. For this reason, Australia needs to look to other nations with similar defence needs. In this case, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all face defending an air-sea gap. Australia should enter a partnership with these nations to create a strike fighter that satisfies the strategic needs of defending an air-sea gap. The benefits of such a partnership will be many.</td></tr><tr><td>Insecurity: (Or Why Americans Aren't Feeling The Recovery) The New Republic's website is currently carrying an interesting piece which tries to explain the anomaly that although the US economy is growing, a lot of its citizens are still feeling worse off.

Add in some tried and tested limited supply marketing, a store that looks as good as Louis Vuitton and a high impact award winning advertising campaign that has covered Tokyo in pink, green and yellow for weeks, and some of the reasons for the iPod mini phenomenon can be understood. #148; Aug 10"

    "Now that we have loaded our text dataset, the next step is to convert the text data into **numerical representations** using **text embeddings**. Here we will demonstrate how easy it is to take our text and embed it using a foundational model from Mosaic AI Model Serving. In particular, we will be using the `get_open_ai_client()` method, which is part of the databricks SDK that provides a convenient way to create an OpenAI-compatible client for interacting with the foundation model. For other methods of querying, please see [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models). \n",

    "## Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) clustering, we need to determine the **best number of clusters (K)**.  \n",
    "We use the [**Elbow Method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_of_a_curve), which helps identify the point where adding more clusters **no longer significantly reduces inertia (sum of squared distances to cluster centers).**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does the Elbow Method Work?**\n",
    "- We run **K-Means** clustering for different values of K (from 1 to 10).\n",
    "- We measure **inertia** (how well points fit within their assigned cluster).\n",
    "- We plot inertia against K and look for the [**elbow point**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering) where the decrease in inertia slows down.\n",
    "- The **optimal K** is found using **KneeLocator**, which detects the elbow point automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not just minimize inertia?**\n",
    "- Minimizing inertia can lead to _overfitting_ (continuously decreasing while increasing the number of clusters will fit noise rather than meaningful patterns).\n",
    "- The elbow method provides interpretability and voids arbitrary decision-making by providing a point of diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We manually set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to 1 to avoid multithreading and parallelism to ensure that each run uses the same computational resources. This prevents the creation of too many threads across processes, preventing inefficient CPU utilization."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this demo, we explored the process of **training an unsupervised model** using **K-Means clustering** on **text embeddings**. We generated embeddings with **Databricks foundation models**, standardized the data, and applied **dimensionality reduction (PCA)** to optimize clustering. By using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**, we determined the optimal number of clusters and evaluated the quality of our model. This approach helps in discovering hidden patterns in text data, making it a powerful technique for **automated categorization and pattern recognition** in **real-world applications**.\n"
