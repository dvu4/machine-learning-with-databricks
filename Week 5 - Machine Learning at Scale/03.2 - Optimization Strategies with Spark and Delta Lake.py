# MAGIC ### Key Optimization Features in Delta Lake
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **OPTIMIZE**: Coalesce small files into larger ones, improving read performance by reducing the overhead of managing small files.
# MAGIC - **VACUUM**: Clean up old data files that are no longer referenced, ensuring that the storage system is efficient and up-to-date.
# MAGIC - **Z-ORDER Clustering**: Optimize the data layout based on the clustering of specific columns, significantly speeding up queries.
# MAGIC - **Liquid Clustering**: For more advanced automatic clustering, which incrementally clusters new data.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Steps for Running Delta Lake Optimizations:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Run OPTIMIZE on Delta Tables**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This step will compact smaller files into larger ones for faster query performance. Delta Lake helps with incremental clustering on optimized tables.

# COMMAND ----------

# OPTIMIZE the Delta table to compact small files
spark.sql(f"""
OPTIMIZE {DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.distributed_predictions_table
""")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC - **Run VACUUM on Delta Tables**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC VACUUM is used to remove files no longer referenced by Delta tables, such as old versions of data that were overwritten or deleted.

# COMMAND ----------

# Disable the retention duration check
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", "false")

# VACUUM to remove old files no longer referenced by the table
spark.sql(f"""
VACUUM {DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.distributed_predictions_table RETAIN 0 HOURS
""")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ###Advanced Optimization Strategies:
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ####Liquid Clustering
# MAGIC Liquid Clustering incrementally clusters new data for optimal query performance, automatically selecting and updating clustering keys based on historical query workloads.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ALTER TABLE distributed_predictions_table
# MAGIC CLUSTER BY (quality, alcohol);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Once enabled, predictive optimization intelligently selects the best clustering keys for performance improvement, monitoring and adjusting clustering columns over time based on query patterns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more information, refer to the [Delta Lake Liquid Clustering Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ####Z-Ordering:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Z-Ordering clusters the data for faster query performance by optimizing the data layout on disk, reducing I/O operations during query execution. This is particularly useful if queries frequently filter on specific columns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **🚨Note: You will receive an error in the next cell because the table was created using liquid clustering. The next cell is only for code demonstration.**

# COMMAND ----------

# Z-Ordering the Delta table based on columns used in queries (e.g., `quality`)
spark.sql(f"""
OPTIMIZE {DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.distributed_predictions_table
ZORDER BY (quality)
""")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ###Comparison of Query Performance Before and After Optimization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before applying the above optimizations, queries may take longer to execute due to the need to scan multiple small files or non-optimized layouts. After performing OPTIMIZE and VACUUM, expect:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - 2x faster query performance.
# MAGIC - Up to 50% savings in storage due to file compaction and cleanup of old data files.
# MAGIC - No manual effort required for ongoing optimizations when predictive optimization is enabled at the account level.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps to Compare Query Performance:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Step 1:** Measure Query Performance Before Optimization
# MAGIC - **Step 2:** Apply Delta Lake Optimizations
# MAGIC - **Step 3:** Measure Query Performance After Optimization
# MAGIC   - Run the same query again after optimizations and measure the time taken.
# MAGIC - **Step 4:** Measure the time taken and compare the results.
# MAGIC   - Calculate the improvement in query performance.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ##Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we explored key Delta Lake optimization strategies to enhance the performance of machine learning workloads deployed on Apache Spark. By applying optimizations like **OPTIMIZE**, **VACUUM**, and **Z-ORDER clustering**, we demonstrated how to improve query execution times and reduce storage costs. Additionally, we introduced **Liquid Clustering** as an advanced technique for dynamically managing data layout based on query patterns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We also performed a performance comparison to quantify the improvements achieved by these optimizations, emphasizing the importance of efficient data layout and management in large-scale data systems. With these Delta Lake techniques, you can significantly reduce latency and optimize resource consumption, making your model serving pipeline more scalable and responsive to real-time demands.
