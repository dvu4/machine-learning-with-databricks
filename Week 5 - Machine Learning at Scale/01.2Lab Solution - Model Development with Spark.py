# MAGIC 1. Use the `spark.read.format("delta")` method to read the Delta table.
# MAGIC 2. Display the schema of the DataFrame to understand the structure of the dataset.
# MAGIC 3. Preview the data using `display()` to ensure it’s loaded correctly.

# COMMAND ----------

# Load data into a Spark DataFrame
housing_df = spark.read.format("delta").load(f"{DA.paths.working_dir}/v01/large_california_housing_delta")

# Display schema

# Display data
display(housing_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 1.2: Perform Basic Data Manipulations

# Display filtered data
display(df_filtered)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Exploration Prompt:**

# MAGIC 1. Define the path to the output Delta table.
# MAGIC 2. Save the DataFrame using the **Delta Lake write modes**, such as `overwrite` or `append`.
# MAGIC 3. Verify the saved data by reading it back from the Delta table and displaying it.

# COMMAND ----------

#  Define the output Delta table path without using dbfs
output_delta_table = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.lab_delta_table"

# Save the filtered DataFrame to a Delta table (overwrite mode)
df_filtered.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(output_delta_table)

# Verify by reading the data back from the Delta table
df_output = spark.read.format("delta").table(output_delta_table)

# Display the data read from the Delta table to verify
display(df_output)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
