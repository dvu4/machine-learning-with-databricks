# Select specific columns for the regression task
df_selected = df.select("fixed_acidity", 
                        "volatile_acidity",

# MAGIC ## Part 2: Model Development
# MAGIC In this Part, we will focus on building a machine learning model using **Spark ML**. We will explore the steps required to prepare data for model training, train a regression model, and evaluate its performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will also cover how to create and fit a **Pipeline** in Spark to automate data transformations and model training, making it easier to manage and reproduce these steps.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Perform a Reproducible Train-Test Split Using Spark ML
# MAGIC A crucial step in developing a machine learning model is to split the dataset into a **training set** and a **test set**. This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on another, helping assess its performance on unseen data. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we will use **Spark ML** to split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. By setting a **seed**, we can ensure the *random* split is reproducible, meaning the data will be split the same way every time we run this step.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions**:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Use the `randomSplit` function from Spark to divide the dataset into training and test sets.
# MAGIC 2. Specify the proportions for the split: 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
# MAGIC 3. Set a random seed (e.g., `seed=42`) to ensure the split is reproducible across different runs.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **[Spark ML DataFrame API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.randomSplit.html)**: Learn more about splitting data and handling DataFrames in Spark ML.

# COMMAND ----------

# Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets
train_df, test_df = df_filtered.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Display the number of records in each set
print(f"Training Data Count: {train_df.count()}")
print(f"Test Data Count: {test_df.count()}")

print("Train dataframe after splitting : ")
train_df.limit(10).display()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Model Preparation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the data is split into training and test sets, the next step is to prepare the features for model training. This involves **assembling the selected features** into a single vector that can be fed into the machine learning model. Spark ML’s `VectorAssembler` is a key tool for this process, as it consolidates multiple feature columns into one vector.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Assemble a Feature Vector Using Spark ML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we will use VectorAssembler to combine the relevant feature columns into a **single feature vector**. This vector is necessary for feeding the data into machine learning models that expect the input features in a vectorized format. Additionally, we will apply **feature scaling** using StandardScaler to normalize the feature values, which is an important step for models like **Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. However, **tree-based models (like Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests) do not require feature scaling** as they are not sensitive to feature magnitude.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC 1. **Select the feature columns** from the dataset that will be used to train the model.
# MAGIC 2. **Use VectorAssembler** to assemble these feature columns into a single vector named `features`.
# MAGIC 3. **Normalize the feature vector** using StandardScaler:
# MAGIC    - `withMean=True` → Centers the data by subtracting the mean (zero-centered features).
# MAGIC    - `withStd=True` → Scales features by dividing by the standard deviation (column-wise scaling).
# MAGIC 4. Apply the transformations to both the training and test datasets.

                   "volatile_acidity", 
                   "citric_acid", 
                   "residual_sugar", 
                   "chlorides", 
                   "free_sulfur_dioxide", 
                   "total_sulfur_dioxide", 
                   "density",

                   "sulphates", 
                   "alcohol"]

# Assemble the feature vector
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_columns, outputCol="features")

# Apply the assembler to the training and test datasets to create the 'features' column
train_df = assembler.transform(train_df)
test_df = assembler.transform(test_df)
print("Train dataframe after assembling features: ")
train_df.limit(10).display()

# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaled_features", withMean=True, withStd=True)

# Fit the scaler on the training data
scaler_model = scaler.fit(train_df)

# Transform both the training and test data using the same scaler model
train_df = scaler_model.transform(train_df)
test_df = scaler_model.transform(test_df)
print("Train dataframe after scaling : ")
train_df.limit(10).display()

# Display the scaled features
display(train_df.select("scaled_features", "quality").limit(10))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Model Training
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After preparing the feature vectors, the next step is to train a machine learning model. In this section, we will use a **Linear Regression Model** to fit a regression model. Additionally, we will streamline the model training process by creating and fitting a **Pipeline** in Spark ML, which automates the data transformations and model training steps.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Fit a Model Using Spark ML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we will train a machine learning model using the Linear Regression algorithm. Linear Regression is a common method for regression tasks, as it estimates relationships between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC 1. **Initialize the LinearRegression model** and specify the necessary parameters, such as the input feature column (scaled_features) and the target column (quality).
# MAGIC 2. **Train the model** on the training dataset using the fit() method.
# MAGIC 3. **Make predictions** on the test dataset using the transform() method.

# COMMAND ----------

lr_predictions = lr_model.transform(test_df)
lr_predictions.limit(10).display()

# Display the predictions
lr_predictions.select("scaled_features", "quality", "prediction").limit(10).display()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Create and Fit a Pipeline Using Spark ML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To automate and streamline the machine learning workflow, we can use **Pipelines** in Spark ML. A pipeline chains multiple stages of data transformation and model training, making the process reusable and easy to manage. In this case, we will chain the feature assembler, the StandardScaler, and the Linear Regression model into a single pipeline.

# MAGIC ### Model Evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the model has been trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance on unseen data. In this section, we will:
# MAGIC - **Generate predictions** using the test dataset.
# MAGIC - **Evaluate the model’s performance** using key regression metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R²** (Coefficient of Determination).
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Compute Basic Predictions Using a Spark ML Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After the training phase, you can use the model to make predictions on the test data. The predictions are then compared with the actual values to measure the model’s accuracy.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Ensure the `features` column** is ready for predictions by dropping any pre-existing version in the test DataFrame.
# MAGIC 2. **Use the trained pipeline** to make predictions on the test data.
# MAGIC 3. **Display the predictions** alongside the actual values for comparison.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## This code just convert test df back to original test_df by removing "features", "scaled_features" columnms

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Evaluate a Regression Model Using a Spark ML API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To measure how well the model is performing, we will use two key metrics: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R²** (Coefficient of Determination). RMSE gives us the average prediction error, while R² indicates how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Initialize evaluators** for both RMSE and R² metrics using the `RegressionEvaluator` API.
# MAGIC 2. **Evaluate the model** using both metrics.

# MAGIC ### Model Registration (Optional)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the model is trained and evaluated, we can register it in **Unity Catalog** using **MLflow**. Model registration is essential for maintaining version control, enabling model sharing across teams, and facilitating model deployment in production environments. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By logging the model with MLflow, you can track metrics like **RMSE** and **R²**, and make the model accessible for further usage, versioning, or deployment.
