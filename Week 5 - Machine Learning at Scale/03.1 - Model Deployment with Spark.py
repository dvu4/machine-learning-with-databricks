# Assemble features into a vector
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_columns, outputCol="features")
df_with_features = assembler.transform(df)

# Split the data into training and test sets (for SparkML Model Training)
train_df, test_df = df_with_features.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)
# Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame for single-node model training
train_pandas_df = train_df.select(feature_columns + ["quality"]).toPandas()
test_pandas_df = test_df.select(feature_columns + ["quality"]).toPandas()

# Split features and target variable

# MAGIC ## Part 1: Methods to Deploy Machine Learning Models in Spark
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Spark provides multiple approaches for deploying machine learning models, making it a powerful and flexible framework for both data processing and model serving. Depending on the size of your dataset and the computational requirements, you can choose from two main approaches for model deployment:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Single-node model deployment:** The model is trained and executed on a single machine. Even though the model is single-node, Spark can still distribute the data for processing. This approach works well for smaller datasets and simpler applications.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC - **Distributed model deployment:** This approach fully leverages Spark's distributed architecture to handle large datasets and complex computations. Models are deployed across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it suitable for large-scale machine learning tasks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more information on Spark MLlib and its capabilities for distributed machine learning, refer to the [Apache Spark MLlib Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html).

# MAGIC ### Why Use Spark for Model Deployment?
# MAGIC Apache Spark provides a robust platform for deploying machine learning models at scale. Spark’s ability to process distributed data and its seamless integration with Spark MLlib, Scikit-learn, and other ML libraries makes it a versatile tool for both small and large datasets. By the end of this demo, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to choose between single-node and distributed model deployment and how Delta Lake optimizations can enhance your model's performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key Benefits:**
# MAGIC - **Scalability:** Spark is designed to handle massive datasets, scaling seamlessly across clusters. This makes it ideal for training and deploying models on large data.
# MAGIC - **Versatility:** Spark integrates with various machine learning libraries, including Scikit-learn, Spark MLlib, XGBoost, and more. This allows you to choose the best tools for training your models while benefiting from Spark’s distributed architecture.
# MAGIC - **Efficiency:** With its in-memory processing and parallelized operations, Spark ensures efficient data processing and model serving. This is useful for both batch and real-time inference scenarios.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By deploying machine learning models on Spark, you can achieve high-performance, scalable model serving that meets both real-time and batch processing needs.

# MAGIC ## Part 2: Comparing Single-node and Distributed Model Deployments in Spark
# MAGIC In this section, you will explore and compare two different methods for deploying a machine learning model in Spark using the same model configurations in **Part 1**. We will specifically focus on comparing the training and inference time for deploying the **Decision Tree model** in both single-node and distributed configurations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Single-node model deployment**: We will use the **DecisionTreeRegressor** model from `Scikit-learn`, which runs on a single machine to perform training and inference.
# MAGIC - **Distributed model deployment**: We will use the **DecisionTreeRegressor** model from Spark MLlib, which performs distributed training and inference across multiple nodes in a Spark cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Both methods will be applied to the same dataset. However, the deployment approaches will differ significantly in scalability and computational performance. The single-node model executes training and inference on a single machine, while the distributed model leverages Spark’s parallel processing capabilities across a cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The objective of this comparison is to evaluate the execution efficiency of both configurations in terms of training and inference time.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Train a DecisionTreeRegressor model** using Scikit-learn. Although the data is distributed across the cluster, the training will occur on a single machine.
# MAGIC 2. **Perform inference on the test data** using the trained model.
# MAGIC 3. **Log the model with MLflow** for future reference and tracking.
# MAGIC 4. **Evaluate the model’s performance** by comparing the time taken for training and inference.

# MAGIC ### Distributed Model Deployment with Spark MLlib
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will demonstrate the deployment of a **DecisionTreeRegressor** model using Spark MLlib. Spark MLlib fully leverages the distributed nature of Spark, making it scalable and ideal for training and inference on large datasets.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will train a **DecisionTreeRegressor** model, perform distributed inference, and log the trained model using MLflow for future tracking and deployments.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC 1. **Train a DecisionTreeRegressor model** using Spark MLlib on a distributed Spark DataFrame.
# MAGIC 2. **Log the trained model** using MLflow for version control and future inference.
# MAGIC 3. **Set an alias** for the registered model version to easily identify and retrieve the best-performing model.
# MAGIC 4. **Perform distributed inference** on the test data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Walkthrough:**
# MAGIC - **Initialize the DecisionTreeRegressor model**: We will use Spark's `DecisionTreeRegressor` to initialize and train the model on distributed data, allowing for scalable training.
# MAGIC - **Create a pipeline**: By using Spark's `Pipeline`, we can chain multiple steps, including feature vector assembly and model training, into a single unified workflow.
# MAGIC - **Train the model**: The training will be executed across a distributed Spark DataFrame, which allows for efficient and scalable processing of large datasets.
# MAGIC - **Log the model with MLflow**: The trained model will be logged into MLflow for tracking, reproducibility, and potential future deployments.
# MAGIC - **Set model alias**: We will assign a "champion" alias to the latest model version in MLflow, making it easier to reference the best-performing version for future operations.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will compare the performance of the **Decision Tree Regressor** model deployed in both single-node and distributed configurations. Rather than focusing solely on error metrics, we will assess the performance based on the following key factors:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Training Time**: Measure the time taken to train the model in both single-node and distributed configurations. This will highlight the efficiency of each approach in handling data processing and training.
# MAGIC 2. **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken to perform inference on the test data using each model. This will help compare the scalability of the deployment methods when applying the trained model to make predictions.
# MAGIC 3. **Resource Utilization**: Optionally, monitor and compare resource utilization (like memory and CPU usage) for each approach to understand the resource efficiency of each deployment.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By focusing on training and inference times, this comparison emphasizes the practical differences in scalability and efficiency between single-node and distributed deployments using Spark.
