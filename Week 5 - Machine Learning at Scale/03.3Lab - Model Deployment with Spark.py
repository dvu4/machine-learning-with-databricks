# MAGIC ## Task 3: Delta Lake Optimization Strategies
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, you will explore how to optimize query performance and storage efficiency using Delta Lake features like **OPTIMIZE**, **VACUUM**, and **Liquid Clustering**. These optimization techniques will help compact data files, clean up unused files, and enhance query performance, especially for frequently accessed data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key Delta Lake Optimization Features**:
# MAGIC - **OPTIMIZE**: Compacts small files into larger ones, improving query read performance.
# MAGIC - **VACUUM**: Removes old, unused data files, optimizing storage and ensuring a clean data state.
# MAGIC - **Z-ORDER Clustering**: Clusters data based on columns frequently used in queries, speeding up read times by organizing the data more efficiently.
# MAGIC - **Liquid Clustering**: Automatically adjusts clustering over time based on query patterns for optimal performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Task Outline:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Step 1:** Apply **OPTIMIZE** to compact small files in the Delta table.
# MAGIC - **Step 2:** Apply **VACUUM** to clean up old files and reclaim storage.

# MAGIC ### Task 3.1: Applying OPTIMIZE to the Delta Table  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this task, you will apply **OPTIMIZE** on the Delta table to compact small files into larger ones. This operation reduces the overhead of reading many small files during queries, improving the overall performance of data reads.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC - **Step 1:** Run the `OPTIMIZE` command on your Delta table.

# COMMAND ----------

# OPTIMIZE the Delta table to compact small files

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 3.2: Applying VACUUM to Clean Up Old Files
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **VACUUM** operation removes old, unused data files from the Delta table that are no longer referenced by the latest version of the table. This helps reclaim storage space and ensures that only the necessary data files are retained.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Step:**  
# MAGIC - **Step 1:** Run the VACUUM operation to remove old, unused data files from your Delta table.

# COMMAND ----------

# Disable the retention duration check and apply VACUUM
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", "false")

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**  
# MAGIC - **Step 1:** Run the same query on your Delta table before and after applying the optimizations.
# MAGIC - **Step 2:** Measure the time taken for the query before optimization.
# MAGIC - **Step 3:** Apply **OPTIMIZE** and **VACUUM**.
# MAGIC - **Step 4:** Measure the query performance again and compare the improvement in speed.
# MAGIC - **Step 5:** Display the performance improvement percentage and discuss how the Delta Lake optimizations affected the query time.

# COMMAND ----------

# Define the query you will run before and after optimizations
query = f"""
